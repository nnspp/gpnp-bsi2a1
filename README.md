# German holidays 2025
This App uses the [Public Holiday API](https://date.nager.at/Api).
Due to the task, we've tried to source out various functions (Search, Filter (?), creating List) to reflect on Copilots suggestions. 

## Current and planned features
1. Overall list of this years holidays in Germany, with german (`localName`) and english (`name`) names.
2. Search for specific days by Name (German and English) and Date (including written out Month in German)
3. Filtering for a couple of options (this is currently not implemented)
4. You can switch between Holidays for Germany, Austria and Switzerland (aka DACH) (this is also not implemented)
